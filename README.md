# Project Title

Hook, Line, and Keeper

# Project Description

Hook, Line, and Keeper is a forum based app that helps amateur writers develop a powerful and gripping hook for the beginning of a story or a chapter. 

# Tech

I used tsx to create an app using class based components. The "final" (I'm still going to take this project further) project is published on Heroku.

# Install 

If you pull this project from github run "npm install" or "npm i" to install the necessary libraries.

# Structure

The folder structure for this project is broken up mainly into "pages", "auth", "post-primary", and "post-secondary". The files in "pages" are what call the functionality of the page. While some calls or functionality may exist on these pages, a majority of the functionality exists in "auth", "post-primary", and "post-secondary". There is also "dictionary-api" which utilizes the dictionary api I used for this project. 

Though I didn't use many images in this project, the ones I did use are stored in the "assets" dir. 

# Credits

Thank you to the Eleven Fifty Academy and all of my classmates.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
